# Regression Project with Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net üè†üèö

This project aims to build a regression model from scratch using Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regularization techniques. Additionally, it involves data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to enhance model accuracy.

## Introduction

Regression analysis is a powerful statistical method used to examine the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Regularization techniques like Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net are employed to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of regression models.

## Project Overview

This project will cover the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain the dataset for regression analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies in the dataset.
3. **Data Exploration**: Understand the dataset's structure, relationships between variables, and identify patterns.
4. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the data to gain insights and understand the distributions.
5. **Model Building**: Implement Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regression models from scratch.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models' performance and compare their accuracies.
7. **Fine-tuning**: Adjust hyperparameters and optimize the models for better results.
8. **Conclusion**: Summarize findings and discuss the effectiveness of the models.
